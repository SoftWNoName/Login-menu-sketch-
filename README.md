I have tried to do "something". I made login page and menu. I'am actually forget the menu items and named it like menu1,2,3....
Not sure that i did it right, but check it. 
I think that we should some how attach the sql(or not sql) data base with logins and passwords and add registration button.

PS: I have no idea how to work with github, so sorry if I did something wrong or ruin something :D
